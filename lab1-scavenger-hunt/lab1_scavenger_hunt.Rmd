A note about `MplusAutomation`: 

It is best to install the latest development of the `MplusAutomation` pacakge by installing it straight from github using Hadley Wickham's devtools package. If you do not have devtools installed, first install it and then install `MplusAutomation`. (A reminder that once you have a package installed, you do not need to install it again!). See below:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
install.packages("devtools")
library(devtools)

install_github("michaelhallquist/MplusAutomation")
```

Load packages

```{r}
library(MplusAutomation)
library(tidyverse) #collection of R packages designed for data science
library(here) #helps with filepaths
library(janitor) #clean_names
library(gt) # creates tables
library(DiagrammeR) # create path diagrams
here::i_am("lab1_scavenger_hunt.Rmd")
```

------------------------------------------------------------------------

*Data source*: The dataset used in this example comes from the Longitudinal Study of American Life (LSAL; Miller, 2010), funded by the National Science Foundation (NSF) in 1986. Science attitude items for the LCA were selected based on prior research using the same data (Ing & Nylund-Gibson, 2013, 2017) to create the latent class variable.

```{r, echo=FALSE, eval=TRUE}
tribble(
  ~ "Name",~ "Description",~ "Values",
  "Enjoy","I Enjoy Science","0 = Disagree, 1 = Agree",
  "Useful","Science is Useful in Everyday Problems","0 = Disagree, 1 = Agree",
  "Logical","Science Helps Logical Thinking","0 = Disagree, 1 = Agree",
  "Job","Need Science for a Good Job","0 = Disagree, 1 = Agree",
  "Adult","Will Use Science Often as an Adult","0 = Disagree, 1 = Agree") %>%
  gt() %>%
  tab_header(title = "Binary LCA indicators") %>%
  tab_options(table.width = pct(80)) %>%
  tab_footnote(footnote = "Longitudinal Study of American Life (LSAL)",
               location = cells_title())
```

------------------------------------------------------------------------

```{r, echo=FALSE, eval=TRUE, fig.align='center'}

grViz(" digraph model {

# The `graph` statement - No editing needed

    graph [layout = dot, overlap = true]
 
# Two `node` statements
 
# One for measured variables (box) 

    node [shape=box]
    Enjoy Useful Logical Job Adult;
 
# One for latent variables (circle) 
 
    node [shape=circle]
    lca [label=<Science Attitudes <br/>C<sub>k</sub>>];
    
# `edge` statements
 
    edge [minlen = 2]
    lca -> {Enjoy Useful Logical Job Adult}
 
 }") 
```

------------------------------------------------------------------------

The data can be found in the `data` folder and is called `lsay_subset.csv`.

```{r}
lsay_data <- read_csv(here("data","lsay_subset.csv")) %>% 
  clean_names() # make variable names lowercase

# Quick data summary
summary(lsay_data)
```

------------------------------------------------------------------------

1.  Using MplusAutomation, estimate a 4-class LCA model using the variable indicators `enjoy`, `useful`, `logical`, `job`, `adult`:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
input  <- mplusObject(
  TITLE = "LSAY 4-Class Model - Lab 1", 
  VARIABLE = "categorical = enjoy useful logical job adult;
  usevar =  enjoy useful logical job adult; 
  classes = c(4);",

  ANALYSIS = 
   "estimator = mlr; 
    type = mixture;",
  
  OUTPUT = "tech11 tech14;",
  
  PLOT = "type = plot3; 
    series = enjoy-adult(*);",
  
  usevariables = colnames(lsay_data),
  rdata = lsay_data)

output <- mplusModeler(input,
                       dataout=here("mplus", "lsay.dat"),
                       modelout=here("mplus","lsay.inp") ,
                       check=TRUE, run = TRUE, hashfilename = FALSE)
```

After estimating a model using `MplusAutomation` , the first thing we need to do is open up our output.
You should make it a habit of always checking your output before moving forward with any code to make tables or figures.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

2.  Locate the following in the output file [note the line number]:

-   Total analysis sample size 

-   Observed item response counts and proportions

-   Number of free parameters

-   Log Likelihood Value

-   Bayesian Information Criteria (BIC)

-   Final class counts and proportions based on the estimated model

-   Model-estimated item thresholds for each class

-   Latent class multinomial logit means (class proportion/size)

-   Class-specific item response probabilities

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Sneak peak of the item probability plot:

```{r}
source(here("plot_lca.txt")) # This is a custom function to plot mixtures from the Mplus output

model <- readModels(here("mplus", "lsay.out")) # read in output

plot_lca(model_name = model)
```
